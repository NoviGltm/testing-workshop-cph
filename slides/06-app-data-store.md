## Non-determinism

- random data in tests makes it very hard
- UUIDs, dates, etc
- Cypress includes XHR and method stubbing using [http://sinonjs.org/](http://sinonjs.org/)
- [https://on.cypress.io/stubs-spies-and-clocks](https://on.cypress.io/stubs-spies-and-clocks)

## Application data store

- inspect in DevTools 'window.app' variable
- can you find the items in the data store as they are added?
  - **hint** you might need 'JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))' to get a "simple" object
