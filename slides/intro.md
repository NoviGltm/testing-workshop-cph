+++

## Repo organization

- `/todomvc` is a web application we are going to test
- all tests are in `cypress/integration` folder
  - there are subfolders for exercises
    - `01-basic`
    - `02-adding-items`
    - `03-selector-playground`
    - `04-reset-state`
    - etc
- keep application `todomvc` running!

We are going to keep the app running, while switching from spec to spec for each part.

## `todomvc`

Let us look at the application.

- `cd todomvc`
- `npm start`
- `open localhost:3000`

**important** keep application running through the entire workshop!

It is a regular TodoMVC application.

## Questions

- what happens when you add a new Todo item?
- how does it get to the server?
- where does the server save it?
- what happens on start up?

Note:
The students should open DevTools and look at XHR requests that go between the web application and the server. Also the students should find `todomvc/data.json` file with saved items.
